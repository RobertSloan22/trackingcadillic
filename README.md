Simple Location Program that takes the geolocation using the browser ip address and sends it to a mongodb cluster.
With Frontend that calls the database and returns the most recent 10 locations stored. 

Roadmap: 
  Continue development and have a raspeberry pi zero with attached gps module and cell module do the location logging. To be used as a personal locator for my car.
